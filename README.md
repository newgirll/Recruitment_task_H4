# Technology

Technologies I have used in the task was HTML - to create a structure, CSS/Sass - to style elements and JavaScript - to dynamicly change colors of hovered element. To automatize my work I have used toolkit- Gulp, thanks to it I could use Sass, watch all changes during my work (browserSync) and add automatically prefixes (autoprefixer) to CSS to be sure that all browsers can read my implemented styles.
